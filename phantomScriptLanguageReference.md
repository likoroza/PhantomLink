# PhantomScript Language Refernce

## Info
Originally we wanted to use DuckyScript, but because of copyright issues we
settled on a new language based on it, PhantomScript. Don't worry, moving to it
is intuitive and easy.

## Comments
To make comments you can either use `#` or `//` at the beginning of the string.Example:
`# This code will not be run`
`// This is a comment`
For now you are not allowed to use comments in the middle of a line.
`TEMP_CODE // This code will throw an error`
